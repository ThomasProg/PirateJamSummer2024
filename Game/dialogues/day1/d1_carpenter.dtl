carpenter (Default): Ah, you must be the new resident!
carpenter: Welcome, welcome!
carpenter (Happy): Is the village to your liking?
- Hard to say, I just got here. Doesn't seem bad, though.
carpenter: It's fairly new. The church gave us the order to establish it not so long ago.
- The church?
carpenter: In a few months, a lot of pilgrims will travel to the cathedral. Happens every year.
carpenter (Sad): The shortest path for some pilgrims is to go through this forest, but...
- But...?
carpenter: ...they keep disappearing.
carpenter (Worried): Probably some wild beasts.
carpenter (Content): Thatâ€™s why the church decided to build a village, to keep the pilgrims safe.
carpenter (Default): The church sent the priest to take charge of managing the settlement. I love building so I'm just here doing my part.
carpenter: I built these huts rather quickly, so if you notice any problem, just tell me!
- I will, thanks!
