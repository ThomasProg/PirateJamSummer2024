Even with my best detective skills, it's still hard to pinpoint one villager.
Do I have any way to narrow it down?
Hmmm...
What if I tried to trick the werewolf?
Telling it something that would make it act differently depending on who it is?
Hmmmmmmm.......
What if I started bluffing?
I could lie and say I made a potion able to kill the werewolf.
But I'm just gonna tell a few people, and if the werewolf doesn't show up tonight, it means one of them is the culprit!
