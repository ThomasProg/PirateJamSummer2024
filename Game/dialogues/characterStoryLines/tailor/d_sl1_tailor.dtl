tailor: Hello, Mr Evil Alchemist.
- Hello, miss bandage.
tailor (Pouting): Bandage?
- You have bandages on your fingers, how did you get hurt?
tailor (Default): Oh, that?
tailor: I just hurt myself when knitting.
- Does it hurt?
tailor (Happy): A little, but I'm now used to it.
- Hmm, I'll try bringing you something next time.
