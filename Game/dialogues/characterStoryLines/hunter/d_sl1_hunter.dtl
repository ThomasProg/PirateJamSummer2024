- Hey
# break
- Why did you moved in this village?

hunter (Default): You know how people sometimes disappear in this forest, right?
hunter (Default): I've heard it was because of a beast.
hunter (Default): I want to hunt it down.
- But isn't that beast the werewolf?
# break
- Then why do you refuse hunting it?
hunter (Default): .. I have my reasons.
