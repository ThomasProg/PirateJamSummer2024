## Eye colors
The wolf can have different eye colors that can change every new night.

### Craft Damage Potions
Depending on the eye color of the wolf, the player has to craft a specific damage potion, and throw it at the wolf when he’s peaking.\
Throwing the correct potion:
- Reduces the aggro of the wolf.
- Can change his eye color

Crafting a damage potion requires time, but no ingredients.

## How to win
The player wins by:
- Surviving long enough
- Getting the aggro of the wolf below a certain threshold

To that end, the player has to:
- Be careful to not let the wolf peek him long enough (or direct game over)
- Use basic potions to prevent the aggro from increasing too much
- Craft damage potions to reduce the aggro
